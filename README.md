This project is a breakout game. 
it was created in November 2018
In the game there is only one level, htough throughout the game the ball will keep gainig speed when it hits a block


## Bugs
There is a bug when the ball hits the corners of the curser(block in the bottom). When the ball hits the corners it will be stock here until you again move the curser, and the ball will mostly fall down.
